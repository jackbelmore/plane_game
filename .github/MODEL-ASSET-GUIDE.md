# 3D Model Asset Guide - Replacing Basic Models

## Current Status
The game uses very basic procedural models generated by Python scripts:
- **Player:** Simple low-poly fighter (11 vertices, ~14 triangles)
- **Enemies:** 3 variants (Red/Green/Black) with similar low detail

These models are functional but visually underwhelming. They lack detail, proper normals, and realistic proportions.

## Option 1: Use Free High-Quality Assets (Recommended)

### Best Sources for Free Fighter Jet Models

#### 1. **Sketchfab** (Best for Game-Ready Assets)
- URL: https://sketchfab.com/
- Search: "fighter jet" or "F-16" with "Downloadable" filter
- License: Look for CC0 or CC-BY (requires attribution)
- Format: GLTF/GLB (native Bevy support)

**Recommended Models:**
- Search "low poly fighter jet" - optimized for games
- Filter by "Animated" if you want moving parts later
- Download as GLTF 2.0

#### 2. **Kenney Assets** (CC0 License - No Attribution)
- URL: https://kenney.nl/assets?q=3d
- Search: "Aircraft Kit" or "Space Kit"
- License: CC0 (Public Domain)
- Format: OBJ/GLTF available
- **Pros:** Clean, consistent style, great for prototyping

#### 3. **Quaternius** (CC0 Ultimate Models)
- URL: https://quaternius.com/
- Look for "Ultimate Spaceships" pack
- License: CC0
- Format: GLTF/FBX
- **Pros:** Modern low-poly, optimized for games

#### 4. **OpenGameArt**
- URL: https://opengameart.org/
- Search: "fighter plane" or "aircraft"
- License: Varies (check each)
- Format: Mixed

## Option 2: Improve Procedural Models

If you want to keep procedural generation but improve quality:

### Enhanced Python Generator Features
1. **Add Normals** - Currently models have no normal data (causes flat shading)
2. **Increase Detail** - More vertices for cockpit, intakes, exhaust
3. **Add UV Coordinates** - For textures later
4. **Separate Meshes** - Cockpit glass, body, wings as separate materials

### Quick Improvement Script
```python
# Add this to generate_model.py
def calculate_normals(vertices, indices):
    """Calculate smooth normals for better shading"""
    normals = [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for _ in vertices]
    
    # For each triangle
    for i0, i1, i2 in indices:
        v0, v1, v2 = vertices[i0], vertices[i1], vertices[i2]
        # Calculate face normal
        # ... (cross product of edges)
        # Add to vertex normals
    
    # Normalize
    # ...
    return normals
```

## Option 3: Quick Fix - Use Blender to Export Better Model

If you have Blender installed:

### Steps:
1. Open Blender
2. Add → Mesh → Monkey (or any mesh)
3. Model a simple jet (or download a free one)
4. File → Export → GLTF 2.0
5. Save to `assets/models/fighter_jet.gltf`

### Blender Free Fighter Jet Sources:
- Blender Market (some free)
- BlendSwap (https://www.blendswap.com/)
- Search "low poly F-16"

## Recommended Immediate Solution

### Download from Kenney.nl (CC0 - Easiest)

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://kenney.nl/assets/space-kit
2. Download the pack
3. Extract and find a suitable spacecraft model
4. Convert to GLTF if needed (Blender can do this)
5. Copy to `assets/models/fighter_jet.gltf`

**Alternative - Simple Fighter:**
1. Go to https://kenney.nl/assets/racing-kit
2. Look for "plane" models
3. Download as OBJ
4. Convert to GLTF via Blender or online converter

---

## Testing Current Models

To see what the current models look like in-game:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The player plane should be loading from `fighter_jet.gltf`. If it looks like a simple blue cube, the model isn't loading (fallback visual).

---

## Converting Formats to GLTF

### OBJ to GLTF (Blender)
1. File → Import → Wavefront (.obj)
2. File → Export → GLTF 2.0
3. Options: Check "Apply Modifiers", "Include Normals"

### FBX to GLTF
1. Same process as OBJ in Blender
2. Or use online converter: https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion/fbx-to-gltf

---

## Integration Steps (Once You Have a Model)

1. **Place the file:**
   ```
   assets/models/fighter_jet.gltf
   ```

2. **Code already loads it:**
   ```rust
   let model_handle = asset_server.load("models/fighter_jet.gltf#Scene0");
   ```

3. **Test:** Run the game and look for the model
   - Blue cube = fallback (model not loaded)
   - Detailed model = success!

4. **If model is too big/small:**
   ```rust
   // In spawn_player(), adjust scale:
   model_parent.spawn((
       SceneRoot(model_handle),
       Transform::from_scale(Vec3::splat(0.5)), // Scale down 50%
       // ...
   ));
   ```

5. **If model faces wrong direction:**
   ```rust
   Transform::from_rotation(Quat::from_rotation_y(std::f32::consts::PI))
   ```

## Recommended Action Plan

**EASIEST PATH:**

1. **Quick Win:** Go to https://kenney.nl/assets/space-kit
2. Download the Space Kit pack (free, CC0)
3. Find `craft_speederC.glb` or similar fighter-like model
4. Rename to `fighter_jet.gltf` (or convert if GLB)
5. Replace current file in `assets/models/`
6. Run game - should look MUCH better

**BEST QUALITY:**

1. Go to Sketchfab
2. Search "low poly F-16 fighter jet"
3. Filter: Downloadable, Sort by Popular
4. Download as GLTF
5. Attribution: Add creator's name to README credits

**DIY IMPROVEMENT:**

I can enhance the Python generator to add:
- Proper normals (smooth shading)
- More detailed geometry (50+ vertices)
- Cockpit glass transparency
- Wing control surfaces
- Engine exhaust details
